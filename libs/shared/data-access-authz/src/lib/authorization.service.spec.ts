// Test for the ability to accept a route and return a boolean answer
// Test for correctness of the answer in the context of:
//   * performing the calculation locally AND
//   * unique route edge cases (special admin routes)
//   * unique user edge cases (no user yet)
//   * mock or stub
// Alternatively, if there are additional business rules in addition
// to server side rules, these should be tested as well.
// Do not test for server side correctness. (Stub out the server)
